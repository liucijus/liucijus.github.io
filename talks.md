#### Can You Trust Your Tests (An Introduction to Mutation Testing)
Nobody argues these days that unit tests are useful and provide valuable 
feedback about your code. But who watches the watchmen? Or, in other words, 
who is testing tests themselves? Let's talk about test code quality, code 
coverage and introduce mutation based testing techniques. Ideas behind 
mutation testing are nothing new in academic world, but only now become 
recognized by software developers while programming their production 
systems. This talk will look into how mutation testing can be used to 
improve your test-driven development cycle and will try to answer if 
existing tooling is mature enough to be used while coding your daily tasks.

#### TDD: Discover Implementation by Stepping Small
Enough with the theory! Let's look into how classical TDD techniques are 
applied to discover algorithm implementations by moving forward with baby 
steps and triangulating into more generic implementation. This talk is fully 
based on live coding in Scala, but does not require any prior experience with 
the language. It covers the following techniques: baby steps, transformation 
priority premise, mutable vs. immutable code, functional programming habits 
that may get in the way. It will end with introduction to tail call 
optimization by leaving audience with an open question which code was more readable.
_I've given versions of this talk in Scala, JavaScript, Ruby & Python_

#### Developer Tests - Things to Know
There are many great talks that discuss challenges developers 
face when writing software tests. In this talk let's look 
at test design problems that may seem to be simple but yet 
fundamentally important and often misunderstood even by 
experienced programmers.
