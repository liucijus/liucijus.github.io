I'm Vilnius Scala organizer and co-founder of Vilnius JUG. While not shredding on my mountain bicycle, I enjoy speaking 
about software design, test first techniques and how both things fulfill each other. 

I have more than 10 years of experience in software development and currently take Guild Master role in backend 
engineering team at Wix.com where I try to influence how engineers design their software. 
Wix.com is a leading website building platform built by passionate R&D team which enjoys tackling high scale challenges.
